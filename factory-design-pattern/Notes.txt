The Factory Pattern is used to encapsulate object creation logic so that the client code doesn’t need to know the specific class or how the object is constructed.

When to Use the Factory Pattern?
1. You have multiple classes implementing a common interface.

2. You want to decouple object creation from its usage.

3. You expect to frequently add new object types (e.g., new INotification implementations).

4. You want to centralize creation logic—especially useful in large applications to reduce duplication.

5. You want to avoid using new all over the place, which tightly couples your code to specific implementations.
